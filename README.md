# C++ headers include graph

Do you want to see how looks headers include tree in your project? Then this tool is for You.

Generate headers include tree of whole C++ project in form of GraphViz graphs.
Tool parses output of `g++` and `clang` compiler and presents it in form of graph.

Key features:
- generate include graphs
- count number of includes in objects per header
- estimate size of header with it's includes
- rank headers per total size
- generate HTML page with clickable graphs and statistics

Generator works with `Makefile`, `make`, `cmake` and `catkin` projects.



## How to use?

Generator as input needs build log of `gcc` or `clang` compiler. Compilation have to be done using `-H` flag
informing compiler to print include tree to `stderr`.
Passing the flag to `cmake` and obtaining build log can be done in following way:
```
    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
          -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-H" \
          -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-H" \
          ...
    cmake --build . -- -j 1 2>&1 | tee build_log.txt
```
Similarly, running `make` can be done like this:
```
    make CXX_FLAGS="-H" -j1 2>&1 | tee build_log.txt
```
Following command works for `Makefile`-s generated by `cmake` (it's impossible to change compiler settings without 
calling `cmake`). For custom made `Makefile`-s investigate the file (try *standarized* `CXX="g++"` and `CXXFLAGS="-H"`).

Note that `cmake` and `make` have to be executed with one job only (`-j 1`), because otherwise compiler output will be 
interweaved and impossible to parse.

When build log is collected then it's time to execute the generator. 
There is example of generating graph for `cmake` output:
```
    cppincludegraphgen -lf build_log.txt --reduce_dirs "/opt" "/usr" --outdir include_graph_reduced
```
Whole commands list can be found [here](doc/cmd_args.txt). List is produced by calling `cppincludegraphgen --help`.
Highlighted arguments:
- `--files_info` information about source and compiled files. Parameter is helpful when compilation is done in containers or remote locations. 
File can be generated using `cppincludegraphdump` script.
- `--reduce_dirs` informeds generator to *cut* subtree of headers in given directories amd present graph in reduced form (see examples).
 
Other arguments seems to be straightforward.

For more details see examples below.



## Makefile example

In `examples/cpp-makefile` there is example of include tree generated based on Makefile project.

Generator is executed with following command for reduced and full graph respectively:
```
cppincludegraphgen -lf build_log.txt --build_regex "^g\+\+.*-o (\S*)$" --markhotpath --reduce_dirs "/opt" "/usr" --outdir include_graph_reduced

cppincludegraphgen -lf build_log.txt --build_regex "^g\+\+.*-o (\S*)$" --markhotpath --outdir include_graph_full
```

Note that there is `--build_regex` passed through command line. It highly depends on configuration of `Makefile` file and it's output to stdout.

## CMake example

In `examples/cpp-cmake` there is example of include tree generated based on CMake project.

Generator is executed with following command for reduced and full graph respectively:
```
cppincludegraphgen -lf cmake-tutorial.txt --namefromlogfile --nohighlight --reduce_dirs "/opt" "/usr" --outdir include_graph_reduced

cppincludegraphgen -lf cmake-tutorial.txt --namefromlogfile --nohighlight --outdir include_graph_full
```

## catkin example

Generator is executed with following command for reduced and full graph respectively:
```
cppincludegraphgen --log_dir "/path/to/catkin/log/dir" --log_name "build.make.log" --outdir catkin_include_graph
```

Generator will search for catkin log files in given directory, parse it and produce the graph. Alternatively list 
of log files can be passed as command line argument: 

`--log_files /path_01/build.log /path_02/build.log ...`
